Download the file and search for the flag based on the known prefix.

## Step by Step

First, download the flag data given in the Description above

```bash
wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/296/anthem.flag.txt

Open the flag using ``cat`` command, it will give you a bunch of anthem lyrics

Remember to read the category of the problem, which is ``grep``

Grep is a command which you can use to find/grab the text you want

We can ``grep`` the flag format which is ``picoCTF``
